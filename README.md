# Arduino_Nebulous_Lamp
Arduino code for Nebulous Lamp Machine

I created an interactive color changing lamp for the ARTD 370 Digital Interactivity class at the University of Oregon. 
An Arduino Uno chip was programmed to read input from three touch sensors and use this imput to decide what RGB values would be displayed by an LED light strip.
The program also read input from a dial at the top of the lamp that decided the brighness level of the LED strip. 
The file in this repository is the Arduino code that was stored in the chip.

A video of the lamp in action can be viewed here: https://vimeo.com/640056028
